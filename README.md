# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to use Open Weather API's and Google Maps API's to make an application that plans vacations and travel itineraries. The first part of the project involved retrieving weather data from a several thousand randomly generated coordinates and adding the data to a pandas DataFrame. The second part of the project asked for customer inputs regarding weather preferences. Using those preferences, the application was designed to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The output, as seen below, is an interactive marker layer map with pop-up markers displaying the hotel name, city, country code, and current weather conditions. The third and final part of the project used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customer's possible travel destinations. This also outputs an interactive marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary as shown below.
